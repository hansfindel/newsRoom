In a new&nbsp;<a href=\"http://marc.digitalcitymechanics.com/2012/11/14/my-take-on-like-gate/\">blog post</a>, Canter praises Cuban's decision, which he sees as signficant.</p>\n<div>Canter and others are using the term \"Like-gate\" to describe the situation in which Facebook charges brands and individuals to &nbsp;communicate with the audiences they've amassed over the past few years.</div>\n<p>Recently Facebook changed its algorithm in such a way that it radically reduced the ability of brands to reach their Facebook followers. Some brands saw their reach drop by 40% or more overnight.</p>\n<p>Cuban says he'll start looking elsewhere for ways to reach people. He'll still be on Facebook, but will emphasize other channels such as Twitter, Tumblr and Myspace.</p>\n<h2>Closed Systems Versus Open Web</h2>\n<p>Canter, a big-time left-winger, goes off on a bit of a rant about how capitalism itself needs to change but then circles back to make an interesting point about the nature of the new generation of tech entrepreneurs, whose attitudes he finds despicable.</p>\n<p>\"They think it's perfectly fine to have Facebook's paywall charge brands to sneakily insert ads which look like stories into users' activity streams. This is because these people don't really believe in the free and open Web,\" Canter writes.</p>\n<p>\"They think that it's ALL about exploiting and manipulating and tricking people -- so that they can make money off of these tricks. That's their interpretation of the opportunities that our free Web gives them. That's why they LOVE Facebook,\" Canter says.</p>\n<p>Canter ends on a hopeful note, saying that while a bunch of opportunists may try to exploit closed systems for their own gain, in the end, \"the free and open Web will just route around these people.\"</p>\n<p>What do you think?

By 2016, it would like to replace as many of those as possible with robots that can do the job 24/7.</p>\n<p>That would address the <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/18/foxconns-response-to-underage-workers-its-true\">human rights concerns</a> about the company's working conditions. But is it worth putting 1.2 million people out of work? It's the classic globalization question.</p>\n<p>Foxconn <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-07/30/c_131018764.htm\">declared its intentions</a> to go robotic last year, announcing that it had 10,000 robots online, ramping up to 300,000 this year. The goal as stated in the <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-07/30/c_131018764.htm\">2011 Xinhua article</a> was to get to 1 million robots by 2014. This <a href=\"http://www.techweb.com.cn/it/2012-01-13/1141572_3.shtml\">TechWeb post from January</a> (which was brought to my attention by <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/foxconn-allegedly-replacing-human-workers-with-robots/\">John Biggs at TechCrunch</a> today) says Foxconn would reach the goal this year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/5cL60TYY8oQ\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I used robots to translate the TechWeb post into English, and I think it reveals some interesting tidbits. It describes (vaguely) a gradual process by which certain tasks will be moved over from people to robots, eventually taking over much of the assembly process. Foxconn chairman Terry Gou says that \"Foxconn['s] young people will [re-learn] to [manipulate] robot software, application and maintenance, to become robot application engineers and software engineers, operating the robot and joint production.\"</p>\n<p>It's actually a pretty frank article, acknowledging the tragic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides\">suicides of Foxconn workers</a> in 2010 and attributing it to the monotonous, relentless working conditions. No one wants more of that, let alone the <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/18/foxconns-response-to-underage-workers-its-true\">underage workers</a> that managed to slip through at one factory. The positive PR in the article points to how much more productive Foxconn will be with these robots, which only cost about $25,000 a piece (three times as much as human workers make). The robots seem like a win-win-win-win.</p>\n<p>Foxconn gets unbeatably low production costs and high production volume. Tech companies like Apple might even start <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/26/obama-and-romney-should-quit-worrying-about-china-and-start-worrying-about-education/\">competing with China</a> for robot manufacturing, driving prices even lower. Thus customers get cheaper computers. And Foxconn workers get trained for higher-skilled, less awful jobs. Or some of them do, at least. The unspoken implication is that nowhere close to 1.2 million workers will be necessary.</p>\n<p>The reporter relates this exchange between two Foxconn workers (forgive the Google Translate weirdness):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Are you afraid of robots to fight for a job?\"</p>\n<p>\"A little worried.\"</p>\n<p>\"Robot than you good?\" <em>[Presumably, \"Worried that robots are better workers than you?\"]</em></p>\n<p>\"Not tired, a robot can top several employees, do not get hurt, and so on.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a win-win-win-win-lose. The losers are the Foxconn workers who depend on these manufacturing jobs and will lose them to robots. This isn't just going to affect Foxconn. It's going to come home to all of us, wherever we live, sooner rather than later. Is it worth the trade-off?</p>\n<p>I think it is, but only on one condition, which Vivek Wadhwa articulated on ReadWrite last month: <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/26/obama-and-romney-should-quit-worrying-about-china-and-start-worrying-about-education/\">We have to throw all our efforts into reforming education</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Lead image via <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Electronics_factory_in_Shenzhen.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/tUkoMba2XZdRkys8gKevwMzWvMc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/tUkoMba2XZdRkys8gKevwMzWvMc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/tUkoMba2XZdRkys8gKevwMzWvMc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/tUkoMba2XZdRkys8gKevwMzWvMc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-rEmWPffFfc:O3igFtQssbI:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/-rEmWPffFfc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/-rEmWPffFfc/if-foxconn-replaced-its-humans-with-robots-would-you-feel-better", "published_on"=>2012-11-14 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/14/if-foxconn-replaced-its-humans-with-robots-would-you-feel-better", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000107')}])

Roamz is a mobile app that intelligently curates location-based social content to show people what's going on nearby.</em></p>\n<p>Now, before you jump up and down to disagree, hear me out. I have two beautiful children for whom I am grateful every single moment of the day. However, I can’t help but contrast my experience of founding my first startup as a single 17-year-old with my second, having gained a wife, toddler and a baby who was born just eight months post-launch. And while the tech community has fostered a culture of learning from each other’s successes and failures, what I think is missing from the dialogue is an open and honest discussion about the challenges involved in the co-existence between an entrepreneur's startup life and their personal life.</p>\n<p>While I wouldn’t change my personal circumstances for anything in the world - and I appreciate that each person and their family is different - I would, nonetheless, offer the general advice that it is a bad idea to have a child at the same time as founding a startup.</p>\n<p>Agree or disagree with my argument, but my hope is that entrepreneurs will continue to share their startup experiences including how the choices they make in their personal life impact their startup and vice versa.</p>\n<h2>Being A Founder And A Parent Is Like Running Two Marathons Simultaneously</h2>\n<p>It was midnight last night, and I was waiting for a call from a potential client overseas. I had just re-settled my newborn after his feed and I knew that both he and my three-year-old would be awake for the day in less than five hours. <em>Five hours!</em> It was at that lightbulb moment that I realized that, no matter how much you tell yourself that your personal life won’t impact your work life, in the startup world that simply isn’t true. The closest analogy for what running a startup feels like is running a marathon that never seems to finish. As the business gets to scale, it appears like the race slows down to the point where you can just catch your breath, but you never stop running. Ditto taking care of a newborn. Founding a startup while parenting a baby is like running two startups - one commercial and one human.</p>\n<p>Look, I’m not suggesting that other types of jobs aren’t difficult when you’ve got young kids. You might argue that lots of people hold challenging jobs, and they still manage to raise a newborn. Or your response may even be: “What about senior executives and CEOs? Many have had children during their tenure.”</p>\n<p>Sure they do. But there’s a key difference between a startup founder versus an executive. The founder faces an existential threat to their business every single day. Every extra hour, every moment of thought, every pitch can mean the difference between success or failure.</p>\n<h2>There Are Never Enough Hours In The Day</h2>\n<p>During my first startup, I would go to any networking event I could talk my way into. I built up great relationships with the press, with companies that subsequently developed into customers, and even with other entrepreneurs who provided support and who eventually also became friends. Would I have gone to these events if it meant missing out on seeing my toddler grin from ear-to-ear when I walked through the door in the evening? Similarly, some of my favorite moments in founding a startup are working with my team late at night and watching everyone’s faces when some milestone is hit or some large problem is solved. If you miss these defining moments at your startup the culture and camaraderie will change. When you have a family it’s a constant trade-off.</p>\n<p>To create a successful business, in the early days, an entrepreneur needs to be “always on,” whether it be responding to emails at all hours, listening to feedback on social media or pitching the product or service to anyone who will listen. This necessity to be “always on” is completely incompatible with being the parent of a newborn.</p>\n<p>But on the other hand...</p>\n<h2>Being A Parent Makes Me A Better CEO</h2>\n<p>While I believe that it’s a bad idea to have a child at the same time as founding a startup, I have definitely also benefitted from being a parent and a founder simultaneously. I am a better CEO the second time around, and a lot of it has to do with being a parent.</p>\n<p>Apart from becoming more mature after having kids, I have found that I am able to better empathize with people. I also find that I can cope with the stresses of a startup much better since having children (a server meltdown is nothing compared to a toddler meltdown). I got a different sense of perspective that is hard to explain. It isn’t that I treat the business any more or any less seriously than before, but I feel that I am now better able to separate what’s important for the business from what’s not.</p>\n<p>Running a startup is a roller-coaster ride where some days everything goes your way and other days are just a constant struggle. Being able to come home to the smiling face of a child who thinks you are fantastic melts away the things that went wrong that day and helps you push through to fight the next battle.</p>\n<h2>Don’t Found A Company And Have A Child At The Same Time</h2>\n<p>While I don’t seriously think anyone is going to base their decision of when to have kids on this article alone, I thought it was worthwhile sharing my experiences of founding one startup with kids, and one startup without. Not having children in the first one to two years of founding my first company gave me a lot of freedom and flexibility that I didn’t realize I had at the time. Equally the process of becoming a parent and managing a newborn has given me skills that are unexpectedly useful when founding a company.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs plan every detail of when and how they will start their first venture but one part of the equation that is often forgotten is how they will manage their personal life. Perhaps it is time that we start hearing about how other entrepreneurs balance their work with their private lives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I’m off to grab some sleep before that 5 a.m. wake-up call.</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit:&nbsp;</em><em>Greg McBean</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/BOCm0kkUXDOUsdFDJ0vMLsDpjBI/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/BOCm0kkUXDOUsdFDJ0vMLsDpjBI/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/BOCm0kkUXDOUsdFDJ0vMLsDpjBI/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/BOCm0kkUXDOUsdFDJ0vMLsDpjBI/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=7QZciWcGipI:umIh53uS5tw:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/7QZciWcGipI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/7QZciWcGipI/found-a-startup-and-found-a-family-just-not-at-the-same-time", "published_on"=>2012-11-14 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/14/found-a-startup-and-found-a-family-just-not-at-the-same-time", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa00010a')}])

They’ve invested time and money building up a large audience of followers, only to have the rug pulled out from under them.</p>\n<h2>Cuban Isn't The Only One Who's Angry</h2>\n<p>I’ve heard anecdotally about a huge brand that was complaining recently because it has spent four years building a following of millions of people, promoting its Facebook presence (and, by implication, Facebook itself) on expensive television ads - and now Facebook has flipped a switch and, overnight, their reach dropped by 40%.</p>\n<p>So now they’re done. They’ve been burned, and, like Cuban, they’re looking elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You might argue that Facebook has an integrity problem. What it has done here is a classic bait-and-switch maneuver, one where you change the rules after you get everybody into the tent. It’s the kind of thing you expect from a used-car dealer, not a big publicly traded company.</p>\n<p>And it’s certainly not what you expect from a company that makes such a big deal about how it doesn’t care about money, but is instead driven by a social mission. If Facebook really doesn’t care about money, why is it shaking down its best partners in such an ugly way?</p>\n<h2>The Real Problem</h2>\n<p>But Facebook has a much larger problem than a lack of integrity. Facebook has a business model problem.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Facebook will rake in $5 billion this year. But&nbsp;Facebook will celebrate its ninth birthday in a few months and the company still keeps poking around and testing new ways to generate revenue.</p>\n<p>Facebook's&nbsp;long-term problem is that it is trying to make money via advertising, even though Facebook simply isn’t a very good vehicle for advertising.</p>\n<p>And while there are things Facebook could do to make itself into a nice platform for advertisers, those things would drive away members. That's the conundrum.</p>\n<p>“A really nice big video ad or interstitial ad would increase their brand advertising revenue,” says Jeff Rosenblum, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.questus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Questus</a>, a digital ad agency in New York, “but the ad would be like interrupting a conversation between friends - annoying and unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>Rosenblum says a possible long-term play for Facebook might involve selling data about its members to advertisers, which could use that data to target ads on other platforms, like TV. He offers an example of two 40-year-old guys who are car shopping - one for a Volvo, the other for a Porsche. Their Facebook data could help advertisers figure out which is which.</p>\n<p>That’s a great idea, but making it happen, and turning it into a billion-dollar business, won’t be easy.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I would never bet against someone who dropped out of Harvard because he had better things to do,” Rosenblum says, “but Facebook is facing some real challenges.”</p>\n<h2>Google+ Takes A Different Approach</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, you know who stands to benefit in all of this? Google. See, Google is approaching social in a different way.</p>\n<p>Google lets you - not some algorithm - control which posts you see. And Gogle doesn’t put ads in your Google+ news feed.</p>\n<p>Instead, Google pulls info <em>out</em> of Google+ and uses that data to improve the results people get when they do a search.</p>\n<p>Google argues that ads work best next to search because people doing searches have reached what’s known as “the moment of commercial intent.”</p>\n<p>For example: You’re shopping for a new dishwasher. You go to Google and type in a search query. Google brings up organic resuts, plus some ads - plus some information from Google+, like the fact that your brother bought a GE dishwasher and highly recommends it.</p>\n<p>In other words: Google is using social to boost the effectiveness of its existing search business. Facebook doesn’t have a search business, so it is stuck jamming ads into your social space, which nobody likes.</p>\n<p>And now, desperate for revenue, it is shaking down members and brand partners alike, pushing them to pay Facebook just to stay in touch with each other.</p>\n<h2>An Opening For Google?</h2>\n<p>Google+ doesn't have anywhere near the 1 billion members that Facebook claims. But it is growing quickly, with 400 million <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+VicGundotra/posts/2YWhK1K3FA5\">members</a> and 100 million monthly active users.</p>\n<p>I imagine a lot of brands that are feeling burned by Facebook are having some very deep and thoughtful conversations with Google these days. They’re all advertising on Google already, of course. But I’m sure Google sees this as a way to grab a bigger piece of their ad budgets.</p>\n<p>Long term, which business model do you think makes more sense? Is Facebook going to drive brands away?

Better yet, comments that garner a bunch of likes will rise to the top, highlighting more interesting or on-point comments.</p>\n<p>Of course, many sites already provide some kind of yea-or-nay feedback system that encourages quality content to rise to the top, user-generated or otherwise.

As soon as Apple launched iOS 5 last year, many of us in the tech press took one look at its iMessage feature and thought the same thing: The carriers are screwed. This week, we saw the first sign that that prediction may be coming true.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For years, mobile carriers have gotten fat on phone-users desire to send each other short, text-based messages. Carriers are still getting a hefty chunk of revenue from texting, but this week they saw the first-ever decline in SMS text messaging, according to <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/text-messaging-declines-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">a new report</a>&nbsp;by independent mobile analyst Chetan Sharma. In the third quarter of this year, the number of text messages people sent to one another in the U.S. dropped by about 2%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That may not sound like much, but considering how fast texting had been growing - especially among young people - the fact that the number declined at all is significant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's not that people are any less connected or firing off any fewer messages. They're just doing it in different ways. One of the biggest culprits is indeed iMessage, which operates exactly as text messages do, but bypasses the carrier entirely for Apple to Apple communications. Another culprit is Facebook's Messenger app. It turns Facebook's desktop IM feature into a very SMS-like communication method, again without having to route messages through the mobile provider.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Rise Of Texting Alternatives</h2>\n<p>I can totally see how this would be the case. Not long after iOS 5 launched, I personally found that a huge percentage of texts I was receiving were actually iMessages, something iOS designates using labels within its Messages app on the iPhone. It just so happened that enough of my friends and people I texted with on a regular basis were using iPhones, so our exchanges were converted into iMessages. It was enough to allow me to eliminate my ultimate texting plan for a cheaper option. Exactly what the carriers didn't want.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Facebook Messenger wasn't originally something I intended on using much, but enough of my friends were using Facebook's mobile messaging feature that I soon found myself opening the app pretty regularly. Once again, this was one less thing I was using SMS texts for. To a lesser extent, other mobile chat apps like imo, Beejive and Skype also decrease our need to use traditional texts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the long run, Facebook Messenger's cross-platform capabilities may actually give it a leg up on becoming the top texting alternative. Unlike iMessage, it's cross-platform, running on iOS, Android and Blackberry. Apple's messaging protocol spans its own devices - iPads, iPhones, iPods and with Mountain Lion, Mac computers. But Facebook's approach is far more platform agnostic, extending browser-based instant messages to mobile devices and allowing those conversations to continue on without interruption, regardless of which mobile platform one is using.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Texting is still huge. It may be quite some time before we see it go away. And to be sure, carriers will be aggressively creative about finding new revenue streams if this one ever drops off. In the meantime, the range of texting alternatives that are available for smartphone can save real money for even the most avid texters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cBgUEWojxRUyeq7j2qEsC_7Xhow/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cBgUEWojxRUyeq7j2qEsC_7Xhow/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cBgUEWojxRUyeq7j2qEsC_7Xhow/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cBgUEWojxRUyeq7j2qEsC_7Xhow/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=-RN3-hl1Jhs:zuxDr10UMNA:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/-RN3-hl1Jhs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/-RN3-hl1Jhs/is-apples-imessage-killing-texting-after-all", "published_on"=>2012-11-14 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/14/is-apples-imessage-killing-texting-after-all", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000111')}])

On Tuesday night, Microsoft invited the Windows 8 environment into the embedded world of cars, kiosks, handheld devices and just about everywhere else.</p>\n<p>Beginning in early 2013, Microsoft will make five versions of Windows Embedded 8 available to developers: Windows 8 Embedded Standard, plus “Pro,” “Industry,” “Handheld” and “Automotive” versions. Microsoft will also release Windows Embedded Compact 2013, designed for small-footprint devices that require flexible hardware, the use of touch- and gesture-based inputs and real-time support. Microsoft also made a <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/evaluate/windows-embedded-8-standard.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">preview release of Windows Embedded Standard available</a> on its website, available today for developers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Windows Has A Long Embedded History</h2>\n<p>Embedding versions of Windows in consumer products like a mall kiosk or a grocery store checkout isn’t new. What products use Windows? Somewhat embarassingly for Microsoft, a great way to find out is to do an image search for something like “blue screen kiosk,” which will pull up pictures of all sorts of products that have used Windows - and crashed.</p>\n<p>But Windows Embedded general manager Barb Edson also said that Windows powers Royal Caribbean's <a href=\"http://www.oasisoftheseas.com/video.php?ship=allure\" target=\"_blank\">Oasis of the Sea</a>, the largest cruise ship in the world, where the systems help employees manage and prevent food spoilage. And a bit closer to home, the <a href=\"http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=cin&amp;sv=1\" target=\"_blank\">Cincinnati Reds</a> use Windows Embedded to manage the team's ticket sales. In all, IDC estimates the market for these “intelligent systems” will be $1.4 trillion by 2016.</p>\n<p>Part of the value of Windows Embedded 8, Edson explained, was selling an end-to-end solution; in other words, Microsoft’s enterprise sales teams go to customers and not only try to sell them the Windows Embedded 8 OS, but also a suite of services that extends into the enterprise: from front-end hardware to back-end analytical tools that can crunch the big data needed to power in-store retail kiosks. Microsoft already has a version of Windows Server and SQL Server optimized for these embedded devices.</p>\n<h2>Buy Cat Litter Using Windows 8?</h2>\n<p>For a consumer, however, the message is simple: If a retailer wishes it, you could be seeing the Live Tile-based Windows 8 “Metro” interface at stores and airports. “There’s an opportunity for the industry to attach devices to the entire infrastructure,” Edson said. “That means there’s a broad opportunity for PCs, phones, tablets and embedded devices combined.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Does that mean that you could be seeing Live Tiles while checking in at the airport? Yes, although you might not recognize them. Although the underlying software infrastructure of a kiosk may be powered by Windows 8 Embedded, a Target store might show you only four live tiles at a time, Edson said: possibly something like “bridal registry,” “today’s discounts” and others. And the retailer has no requirement or&nbsp;incentive to make those kiosks look like a PC.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fields/RWW%20Carls%20Jr.jpg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p>“An OEM [device manufacturer] can build the device they want,” Edson said. “They can use features as they want, with a full experience like a keyboard,” or choose to eliminate some of those additional features. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Certain Windows Embedded 8 versions, such as the Standard version, can “lock down” certain features. The idea is to prevent users from turning the kiosk into a PC that they can play with and possibly hack into. Windows 8 Embedded Standard can turn off certain gestures, for example, prevent the software keyboard from being enabled, or block the Windows 8 “charms” from being shown. On the other hand, using Windows 8 as a foundation should mean that familiar touchscreen gestures should also work on kiosks, making them more accessible to a generation who has grown up on iPads (and Surface tablets, Microsoft hopes).</p>\n<p>The Windows Embedded 8 operating systems support only the x86 chip architecture made by Intel and AMD. Windows 8 Compact supports the ARM processor architecture, making it a sort of Windows RT for the embedded space. That means that customers will have to develop their own apps, but that’s far less of a problem when they're trying to present a particular experience - a dedicated mall kiosk is often designed to run a single application, not play Angry Birds.</p>\n<h2>Handheld Devices - Not Smartphones</h2>\n<p>Don’t expect Windows Embedded 8 Handheld to compete with Windows Phone. The list of handheld devices running Windows Phone Embedded Handheld includes handheld scanners used to track packages for shipment and manage inventory.</p>\n<p>One intriguing question mark will be Windows Embedded 8 for Automotive, which the company hopes will power the next generation of cars. Microsoft isn’t saying which car makers are along for the ride, just that it’s working with a “group of preselected partners” to develop the technology.</p>\n<p>Windows Embedded has long been one of the geekier versions of Windows, hidden away behind counters and in back rooms to link business storefronts to industry management software and other back-room applications. But with Windows 8 designed to be a more cutting-edge, consumer-friendly operating system you might see it sneak into your local mall. Or your next car's dashboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Photo illustration of Ford Sync and Windows 8 by <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/author/fredric-paul\" target=\"_blank\">Fredric Paul</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/oD_FkoIGC2b8MhzzMoOqjc5Ueo8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/oD_FkoIGC2b8MhzzMoOqjc5Ueo8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/oD_FkoIGC2b8MhzzMoOqjc5Ueo8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/oD_FkoIGC2b8MhzzMoOqjc5Ueo8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=XNZxk9NGTOw:-ib5lNRSmpA:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/XNZxk9NGTOw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/XNZxk9NGTOw/windows-8-wants-to-be-in-your-car-and-lots-of-other-places", "published_on"=>2012-11-14 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/windows-8-wants-to-be-in-your-car-and-lots-of-other-places", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000114')}])

Whether using a PC or a smartphone, more customers than ever can now purchase goods and services online, pay in a retail location or transfer money without ever touching their wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While it's not yet time to throw away your wallet, more people than ever are using e-wallets or \"stored value\" cards as a convenient one-step way to pay. A <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2012/PIP_Future_of_Money.pdf\">2012 Pew Internet and American Life Project report</a> found these digital accounts allow customers to also transfer money, purchase goods, and engage in other types of financial transactions. By 2020, 65% of people are expected to have embraced the use of smart-device swiping for completing their purchases, nearly eliminating the need for cash or credit cards. Not surprisingly, <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/05/19/63_percent_of_younger_generation_eager_for_nfc_and_mobile_payments\">younger shoppers are already more comfortable with the technology</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Don't worry, though, the arrival of digital payments doesn't spell the end of other payment methods. “When credit cards arrived, checks did not disappear, and neither did money,” said Amber Case, anthropologist and CEO of <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/16/better-than-getting-rich-quick-startup-geoloqi-joins-esri-for-the-long-hau\">Geoloqi</a>, a company that creates location-based software. “There are [currently] three main methods of payment. If another method of payment is added, we will likely have four methods of payment and retailers and businesses must accept another form of payment. Some systems may emerge that use completely smart payments, but there will still be other forms of payment available.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These e-payment systems are expected to further online spending. Customers would spend $109.8 billion annually if offered a \"no credit card required\" way to pay online and at merchants, according to a 2011 <a href=\"https://www.javelinstrategy.com/\">Javelin Strategy and Research</a> report. Four out of five of those surveyed in the same report said they would spend more online if they considered credit cards safer and had payment alternatives.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Getting Over The Fear Factor</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even as the use of electronic payment systems and e-wallets grow, some customers have legitimate concerns - mostly concerning security.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Recent <a href=\"http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/18/new-cyber-attacks-on-u-s-banks-iran-suspected/\">accusations of cyber attacks on U.S. banks by the Iranian government</a>, as well as high-profile hacking incidents such as the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/saudi-hackers-say-they-published-israeli-credit-card-information/2012/01/03/gIQAkMIMYP_blog.html\">publishing of more than 400,000 credit cards online by a Saudi hacker</a>, do little to ease customer fears that their digital wallets could get cleaned out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For customers to confidently adopt these new payment methods, currency systems need to resolve safety, security and privacy issues, and just as important, remove the <em>perception </em>of risk. “There will always be people who are concerned with the security of their transactions,” wrote Laura Lee Dooley, a strategist for the World Resources Institute in the Pew Internet report. “So the concern of someone hacking into your financial flows will continue to grow, and personal security and device-tracking companies will become an integral and major component of the marketplace.” On the other hand, Lee Dooley also noted that consumers’ fears offers opportunties for businesses to succeed by solving these problems.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Putting Customers In Control</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the future of electronic payments plays out, <em>customers </em>will ultimately determine which systems survive and prosper.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I already see the growing use of digital monetary transactions in my world,\" said Jon Lebkowsky, president of the <a href=\"http://effaustin.org/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation-Austin</a> in Austin, Texas. \"There are some serious discussions of alternate forms of currency, growing in volume as economies seem increasingly shaky. I suspect there'll be innovation here - evolution not just of the medium of exchange but also of the value it represents.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The technology innovations are already coming fast and furious. Person-to-person (P2P) payments can let you send funds to a friend. Retail POS (point-of-sale) systems can be activated using smartphones, merchant cards linked to your digital wallet or online checkout. Mobile checkin lets you connect with a store via a mobile app, sending your picture to the cashier's screen for identification and letting you pay directly from an online account. <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/08/20/nfc-and-the-trough-of-disillusionment\">Near Field Communications</a>&nbsp;(NFC) allows you to wave your smartphone over a scanner to pay for a cup of coffee.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A similar method currently being tested involves transitioning payments between the accounts of individuals - or Account-to-Account (A2A) transactions. These low-cost transfers could go viral as smartphones users increase their use of short-range file transfers. This so called \"bumping\" lets smartphones make payments to merchants - or to each other, simply by touching the devices together.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What could be easier than that?</p>\n<div class=\"p1\" style=\"border-top: 1px solid gray; border-bottom: 1px solid gray;\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\"> <a href=\"http://altfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/3484-161876-37857-3?mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]\"><img style=\"float: none; display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/Paypal_articleBadge%20%281%29.png\" alt=\"\" /></a> </span></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\" target=\"_blank\">Shutterstock</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/KiUuRGcONCXoZTN6cwnT74Q86oI/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/KiUuRGcONCXoZTN6cwnT74Q86oI/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/KiUuRGcONCXoZTN6cwnT74Q86oI/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/KiUuRGcONCXoZTN6cwnT74Q86oI/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YJ3iwljqHIo:iGIadurvJQE:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/YJ3iwljqHIo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/YJ3iwljqHIo/sponsored-post-the-rise-of-the-digital-wallet", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/sponsored-post-the-rise-of-the-digital-wallet", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000117')}])

His girlfriend was looking for a new smartphone and wanted my opinion on what she should get. The choices were the iPhone 5, the Samsung Galaxy S III and, “something from HTC.”</p>\n<p>I cringed. HTC has not had a desirable device on Verizon for a long time. The option presented was the Rezound, the successor to the flawed Thunderbolt and already a year old. When asked if she should consider the Rezound, my response was, “oh god, no.”</p>\n<p>Verizon is the largest cellular carrier in the United States - and the one that sells the highest proportion of Android devices. The fact that HTC has had nothing worth worth buying on the carrier for basically all of 2012 has been a major problem for HTC.</p>\n<p>The Droid Incredible 4G LTE was an also-ran device for HTC on Verizon, a reprise of a past hit updated for 4G LTE. Verizon passed on HTC’s flagship One series - it went to AT&amp;T. Sprint remodeled the One X to be the EVO 4G LTE. Verizon stuck with its aging HTC models even as it released new devices from the likes of Motorola and Samsung.</p>\n<h2>About Time For A New HTC Phone</h2>\n<p>On Tuesday, HTC finally announced a new top-of-the-line smartphone, exclusive to Verizon. The <a href=\"http://news.verizonwireless.com/news/2012/11/droid-dna-htc-smartphone.html\" target=\"_blank\">Droid DNA</a> is a 5-inch Android 4.1 Jelly Bean device that HTC dubs as “the ultimate smartphone.” It’s screen packs a pixel per inch rate of 440 (quite a bit higher than the iPhone’s 326 ppi), an 8 megapixel camera, Beats Audio with a 2.55 volt headset amplifier, 2020 mAh battery and a 1.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor. The Droid DNA will run HTC’s Sense 4 Android skin on top of Jelly Bean. It will be available for $199 on a two-year contract from Verizon starting Nov. 21.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/droid_dna.jpeg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p>The 5-inch screen may be a touch excessive for some, but otherwise the DNA is everything an Android fan might want from a smartphone. Whether or not it lives up to HTC's marketing blather, &nbsp;“the ultimate smartphone” is indeed quality competitor on Verizon.</p>\n<p>That's critical for a comany whose&nbsp;<a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/07/htc-isnt-dead-yet-but-it-is-feeling-mighty-ill#feed=/mobile\" target=\"_blank\">numbers have been abysmal</a> over the last two quarters. HTC's revenue in the third quarter was 23% down from the second quarter and 48% down from Q3 2011. The manufacturer has not gained traction with the One X or the Evo 4G LTE, and the lack of a decent option on Verizon has been even more damning. The most lucrative market of Android users in the U.S. has been essentially lost to HTC for the better part of 12 months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Will the Droid DNA be enough to reverse HTC's downward trend? Not entirely.</p>\n<p>This holiday shopping season has more great mobile devices to choose from than ever before. But expanding its distribution channels with high quality devices has to be one of HTC’s first priorities as it begins climbing back towards the top of the smartphone ladder.

We call them smartphones, but they are really small, powerful digital computers that happen to be able to make phone calls. The mobile operating systems evolved into phone-centric devices because that is what the consumer market wanted. Yet to think that iOS, Android, Windows Phone or BlackBerry are limited to smartphones and tablets gives them short shrift. They clearly have the potential to run myriad other devices.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fields/galaxy_camera_smaller.jpg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p>For instance, Android was built in such a way that it could be deployed everywhere.

MONGODB (0ms) rails3_mongoid_devise_development['articles'].insert([{"headline"=>"IE10 Is Incrementally Changing The Direction Of The Web", "deck"=>"<p>Internet Explorer is slowly, slightly, but significantly changing the Web.</p>\n<p>Tuesday, Microsoft released a preview of IE10 running on Windows 7, <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/12/internet-explorer-10-coming-to-windows-7-and-thats-it\" target=\"_blank\">as expected</a>&nbsp;-- the same version that’s available for the new Windows 8, but translated into the older Windows 7. At the same time, executives with Microsoft’s IE team made the case that content providers have begun incorporating IE10-specific features into their sites, which would benefit those surfing on Microsoft’s latest OS, Windows 8, which has IE10 built in.</p>\n<p>The move may be a response to Google’s Chrome, whose download page tells people to “get their Google back.” Google released both Google search apps and Chrome for Windows 8 last month, as well as a Windows RT-specific search app on Monday afternoon.</p>\n<p>But with just the tiniest change to the functionality of Etsy.com, Pulse.me, and MSN, Microsoft is signaling that IE 10 might be taking a small step toward a more useful, and Microsoft-centric, Web.</p>\n<h2>Swiping To Save Time</h2>\n<p>Take Etsy, where shoppers can browse from literally hundreds of items in the jewelry section alone. Scroll down in the “brooch” section, for example, and a shopper can scroll, scroll, scroll down to the bottom. To get to the next page, those using IE9 and others have to click the right arrow at the bottom. On IE10, they simply swipe right anywhere along the list.</p>\n<p>Is this revolutionary? Maybe not. Etsy could simply break up the list of items into smaller chunks, adding a floating navigation arrow on the site, or even adding navigation elements at the top of the list. But, according to Ryan Gavin, the general manager of Internet Explorer, the simple left and right swipe on sites that offer pages and pages of text -- shopping sites, discussion forums, and others -- is a feature that only IE10 offers. Under Windows 8, Google says that <a href=\"http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2762879\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome doesn’t even offer pinch-to-zoom</a>. It’s a change that Windows 8 and its touch-centric interface has affected the Web.</p>\n<p>“When I’m working with apps, when I’m working with People, when I’m working with the core Start Screen experience, all that works well,” Gavin said. “And then I go onto the Web. And then you have an experience bolted on to something else [with Chrome]. Consumers are saying that’s not what they want any more. They don’t want to think about those two [experiences]. That part, that touch, that whole fluidity, I think that will play a huge part of people’s choice on Windows 8.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fields/rsz_frequent_and_pinned_sites.png\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p>The difference between Chrome and Windows 8's implementation of IE10 is also an aesthetic one: On a tablet, Chrome shows up as a typical browser, with tabs. Microsoft's recent work with Contre Jour pulls the Web out of the browser, so that the Web app fills the screen. People can swipe in and out to expose the Windows 8 charms and other controls, but for the most part, the content fills the screen with no indication that it's inside a browser.</p>\n<h2>Windows 7: Speed, Windows 8: Touch</h2>\n<p>Within Windows 7, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera and even Safari are merely tenants in an office building: All five can hang their signs on the front door, and they all work well.</p>\n<p>In that traditional environment, the focus is on speed, features and the ecosystem, Microsoft cited <a href=\"http://blog.newrelic.com/2012/11/06/browser-wars-a-new-installment-of-our-ongoing-series-on-browser-speed/\" target=\"_blank\">studies from NewRelic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.strangeloopnetworks.com/resources/infographics/fall-2012-state-of-the-union/browser-performance/\" target=\"_blank\">StrangeLoop Networks</a> showing that IE10 was significantly faster (if fractions of a second are significant) than other browsers. Rob Mauceri, the group program manager for Internet Explorer, said that maybe the most notable addition to IE10 on Windows 7 was hardware support for its approach to implementing standard 3D transformations, providing a “consistent and interoperable experience,” he said in an interview.</p>\n<p>Within the Bing/IE combination and Google/Chrome ecosystem within Windows 7, data matters as much as presentation. Google’s search and Chrome apps tap into the Google ecosystem, creating value by leveraging past searches, referencing sites that Google+ friends may have highlighted, and sharing information back and forth across Google services, which, as <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/05/why-microsoft-has-already-won-the-do-not-track-war\" target=\"_self\">Microsoft has pointed out</a>, people don’t necessarily want.</p>\n<p>Those ising IE9 won’t have to worry. The automatic upgrade capabilities built into Internet Explorer will mean that IE9 will upgrade itself to IE10 when the final version is released, probably some time next year. (You will still have to manually upgrade the preview version if they want to try it out.</p>\n<p>IE has about 32.9% market share, according to <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StatCounter</a>, versus 34.8% for Chrome. <a href=\"http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&amp;qpcustomd=0\" target=\"_blank\">Net Applications calculates</a> that IE has 54% of the desktop-PC market, followed by Firefox and Chrome. On Wikimedia, 30.6% of the site’s visitors use Chrome, followed by 22.01% on IE and 19.11% on Firefox. This all means that IE10, on Windows 7 or on Windows 8, will capture a significant portion of the Web.</p>\n<h2>Do You Want The Old Web, Or The New One?</h2>\n<p>That will influence content developers, too.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to be active on the tooling front, as well as more broadly active with the community, the libraries, the multiple building blocks that make developer's' lives easier as they start building these experiences,\" Gavin said, when asked whether developer tools or the browser itself were more important.</p>\n<p>According to Gavin, developers will have to choose whether they build optimized experiences for browsers like Windows 8, or \"lowest-common denominator\" experiences that will work across the Web in a blah, vanilla fashion. Pulse.me went this route, supporting the swipe gesture within the Web page to allow users to move to the next story. That's a feature other content developers will have to choose to support, and they'll all have different answers, he said.</p>\n<p>Originally, Gavin said, he \"may or may not have been a huge fan of MSN,\"&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;<a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/02/microsoft-makes-msn-windows-8s-home-page-and-makes-msn-look-like-windows-8\" target=\"_self\">was recently optimized</a>&nbsp;for Windows 8 and IE10. \"But I like this version,\" Gavin said. \"It's so much like Windows 8. It feels consistent.\"</p>\n<p>Gavin acknowledged that other browser vendors had designed in some of their own touch capabilities. And Windows 7's version of IE10 won't include any overt roadblocks, features that the browser will explictly identify as belonging to Windows 8. But the layout of these updated Web sites may underscore the real message:&nbsp;With Windows 8, Microsoft has designed its own Web. In it, Google, Mozilla, Opera and the others are merely guests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/XCj3284Grwf4Qr6u-C5WMhBfPI4/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/XCj3284Grwf4Qr6u-C5WMhBfPI4/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/XCj3284Grwf4Qr6u-C5WMhBfPI4/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/XCj3284Grwf4Qr6u-C5WMhBfPI4/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=gtpQ0xEw7nQ:aowtHfe-Pg8:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/gtpQ0xEw7nQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/gtpQ0xEw7nQ/ie10-changing-the-direction-of-the-web", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/ie10-changing-the-direction-of-the-web", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000122')}])

If Groupon had gone along for the ride, it would have made history as<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Google\"> Google’s second largest acquisition ever</a> at about half of the $12.5 billion Motorola buy and over three times as much as the price Google paid for YouTube back in 2006.</p>\n<p>Instead the company stayed the course, insisting on remaining independent and confident that it could continue raking in a rumored <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20101203/exclusive-groupon-annual-revenues-actually-2-billion/%20%20\">$2 billion in annual revenue</a>. Talk about seller's remorse.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fields/th21%20groupon%20sf.jpg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<h2>Is There A Daily Deals Bubble?</h2>\n<p>Ask anyone who’s opted out of email alerts for half-price spa days and dinners for two: daily deals served up to your inbox every day can get old -- and fast. Most of tech blogging’s upper echelons have already made a case that the daily deals phenomenon is a fad that’ll come and go with the speed of a limited time Groupon offer, and we’re inclined to agree.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Indeed the daily deals space boasts all the trappings of a true tech mini-bubble, from 2010’s sky-high early valuation to today’s ringing silence where there once was the clamor of companies scrambling to get a piece of the half-off pie. With the buzz waning, Groupon and its ilk (Living Social, Google Offers) have become little more than a fly buzzing around your inbox -- and swatting it away is as easy as clicking unsubscribe.</p>\n<p>The ultimate sign your business model might have jumped the shark? There’s a startup that exists solely to help people <a href=\"https://www.unsubscribedeals.com/%20%20\">get the hell away from your product</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Toss systemic daily deals fatigue on a heap of flaws ranging from understandably disgruntled vendors screwed over by the Groupon model to a green CEO prone to YouTubing naked yoga sessions -- and making stockholders squirm -- and you’ve got yourself a hard sell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The demise of Groupon isn't hard to imagine. As our own Cormac Foster wrote a few months ago when <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/07/16/readwriteweb-deathwatch-groupon\">Groupon made our Death Watch list</a>:</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, it’s likely to become the biggest fish in a much less important pond. It could easily end up as no more than an obscure division of some much larger, more diversified company.”</p>\n<h2>Groupon's Euro-Problem</h2>\n<p>Groupon’s problems arguably run as deep as its business model, but last week CEO Andrew Mason blamed the company’s poor performance in Europe -- and the European debt crisis -- for its woebegone earnings report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;“We followed a different playbook in Europe, focusing on rapidly capturing market share at the cost of investing in technology and innovation and, too often, the satisfaction of our merchants and customers. With a weak European economy, we didn't have the necessary runway to integrate our international business before reaching a plateau in growth earlier this year,\" Mason said.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fields/groupon%20goods.jpg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">The weirdo animal print accessory of your dreams awaits.</span>\n\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<h2>Can Groupon Sell Itself Again?</h2>\n<p>Groupon might be flatlining, but it’s not quite dead yet. The company did recently expand into new-ish territory with Groupon Goods, a <a href=\"http://www.woot.com/%20%20\">Woot-like</a> version of its extant group buying model that serves up deeply discounted products (Yoga leggings! Microfiber duvets! Facelift cream!) rather than less stuff-like stuff.</p>\n<p>Just today Groupon announced free shipping and returns for any items bought through Groupon Goods -- not a bad little holiday season incentive. Groupon is also gunning for Square with a mobile payments system for local vendors that promises to be <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120919/groupon-guaranteeing-merchants-lowest-cost-payments-service-and-its-using-an-iphone/\">cheaper than the competition</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Foster, “If Mason can find new ways to leverage these assets across other products and services (for example, cross-selling full-priced flights or shore excursions at the point of purchase for a discounted cruise), it could build out a convenience-based commerce system and open up new partnership opportunities and compensation structures. If it sticks to online couponing, though, right now is probably as good as things will ever get.”</p>\n<p>In other words, let the Groupon fire sale commence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/2vG3GwFok-nd-T3AcYwI97WCT2g/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/2vG3GwFok-nd-T3AcYwI97WCT2g/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/2vG3GwFok-nd-T3AcYwI97WCT2g/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/2vG3GwFok-nd-T3AcYwI97WCT2g/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kxr9ZGDim8s:pzonTWkb4Q8:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/kxr9ZGDim8s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/kxr9ZGDim8s/groupon-stock-goes-on-fire-sale-but-what-went-so-wrong", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/groupon-stock-goes-on-fire-sale-but-what-went-so-wrong", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000126')}])

That's an electric guitar, for those of you not into that sort of thing. Whether you realize it or not, this is a huge tech story. An entry level model of the most iconic guitar in the world can now plug straight into a PC or iOS device. That opens the world of recorded music to millions of people.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/usbstrat_bottom.jpeg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p>The Mac has already lowered the barrier to entry for aspiring musicians almost to the floor by pioneering the beginner-friendly recording application, GarageBand. PC users have options as well. And with the release of GarageBand for iOS, the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch have also become recording studios for the people. But there was still one hurdle Apple couldn't do much about: It's hard to get the signal from your instrument to the computer.</p>\n<p>There are two options for getting a guitar signal into a computer. You can either mic an amplifier, which takes expensive equipment and lots of experience to get a good sound, or you can use a USB interface. These vary widely in quality, and they're often goofy to set up with your system's audio settings. These obstacles can mean the difference between really making music and just dreaming about doing it.</p>\n<p>By releasing a Strat with USB connectivity, Fender has blown away the last obstacle. Once you have the guitar, which is available <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/product/HA153LL/A/squier-by-fender-usb-stratocaster-guitar\">directly from Apple</a> for $199.95, you can plug it straight into your computer and play. But it's also a fully functional Strat you can play through an amp.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1EtnS98l8q4\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe></p>\n<p>You don't even <em>need</em> an amplifier now. It even comes with a mini-USB to 30-pin connector for plugging into an iOS device. The latest generation of iOS devices have a different port, of course, but a Lightning cable would do the trick.</p>\n<p>As someone who wants the embarrassing era of robotic pop music to die in a fire, I'm overjoyed to see Fender building a real instrument that's this easy for the next generation to use. There's no hiding the soul of a real guitar, and I hope this starts a tidal wave of new, human-controlled instruments for the digital era.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6a3Bb0evAYtQ5aTDjRQ9xPQtrdg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6a3Bb0evAYtQ5aTDjRQ9xPQtrdg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6a3Bb0evAYtQ5aTDjRQ9xPQtrdg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6a3Bb0evAYtQ5aTDjRQ9xPQtrdg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=58iVmGdW5U0:euj0VQOWeyk:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/58iVmGdW5U0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/58iVmGdW5U0/why-fenders-apple-compatible-guitar-is-brilliant", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/why-fenders-apple-compatible-guitar-is-brilliant", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000129')}])

But are we ready for it?</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/NipbX2wNQ1A?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you're a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(character)\">redshirt</a> thinking you might have a case of <a href=\"http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Rigelian_fever\">Rigelian Fever</a>, where do you go for advice? Whether you're planet-side or in the sick bay, odds are you're going to start with a tricorder. In the <em>Star Trek</em> universe, the tricorder was a non-invasive, handheld device that scanned geological, meteorological, and biological data. When used by medical personnel, the tricorder could diagnose all but the rarest diseases.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tricorder inspired <a href=\"http://www.xprize.org/\">X Prize Foundation</a> Chairman Peter Diamandis, who wondered whether – with enough incentive – engineers could build a medical diagnostic tool that could monitor health and identify illness on the spot, without a doctor's assistance. Add in $10 million in total prize money from Qualcomm and you have the <a href=\"http://www.qualcommtricorderxprize.org/\">Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize</a>, launched in January, 2012.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fields/logo.jpg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In an interview earlier this year, Diamandis described the ideal healthcare tricorder:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"A device that is easy and friendly to use that a consumer–whether that's a mom at home at 2:00 in the morning or someone on the road–can use to diagnose themselves without having to go to a doctor or a hospital. It's really about reinventing the future of healthcare.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It's a tall order, but X Prize isn't shying away. A successful tricorder will:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\">Diagnose diseases</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Provide ongoing metrics of health (vitals)</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Allow monitoring or continuous use of sensors to diagnose and measure health</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Provide awareness of health state</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Give confirmation that everything is OK with a consumer</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Notify that something is not OK (a \"check engine light\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">Specifically, the tricorder will be able to identify the <a href=\"http://www.qualcommtricorderxprize.org/files/qtxp.org/QTXP_Guidelines_20120320v1.pdf\">following 11 conditions</a>:</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\">Anemia</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Urinary tract infection</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Diabetes</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Atrial fibrillation</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Strep throat</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Sleep apnea</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Melanoma screen</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Abnormalities in a comprehensive metabolic panel</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Leukocytosis</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\">Any winning device will have to be able to diagnose these conditions routinely and accurately.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fields/Tricordertoy.jpg\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sounds great, right? So is there a catch?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Maybe.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Some people in the medical industry are a bit concerned. The tricorder's goal is the \"<a href=\"http://www.qualcommtricorderxprize.org/competition-details/faqs#de-skilling\">deskilling</a>\" of routine medical checks. Ultimately, for simpler ailments, it aims to <a href=\"http://www.qualcommtricorderxprize.org/competition-details/faqs#strep\">remove doctors from the treatment equation altogether</a>, down the line. Diamandis gets major points for going big in an industry as conservative as healthcare, but are we legally and physically prepared for the consequences?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are plenty of things that could go wrong. What if a device misses a melanoma a visual inspection might have caught? Who's legally responsible for malfunctions? Will a false sense of security cause users to skip routine physical checkups?</p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\">The Thermometer Test</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">To get some perspective, I ran the tricorder idea past a friend of mine who's also an epidemiologist. He shared my enthusiasm, praising \"any technology that gets people more involved managing their own health,\" but immediately applied some cautionary brakes. \"It's a fantastic idea, and a big step when everyone is thinking incrementally. But it also kind of worries me.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The reason? It might not pass \"the thermometer test.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To a doctor, the home thermometer is the single best piece of home medical equipment ever created. \"It's a perfect triage device,\" my friend explained. \"It provides accurate, objective information that medical personnel can use to make judgements. It's a pretty good barometer to judge the severity of many common ailments, but it also doesn't try to diagnose anything.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In other words, a thermometer tells you if you're running a fever, but it doesn't try to tell you <em>why</em>. It provides critical data to healthcare personnel, but leaves the decision-making in their hands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That can make a world of difference, particularly in situations requiring counseling or judgement of the patient's mental state. \"I'd hate to see physicians removed from the discussion. It's not a matter of job security. It's a matter of full-circle patient care.\" He went on to surmise that absent a doctor at the point of diagnosis, users might be more likely to pursue treatment options online, or a diagnosis might unhinge a mentally fragile patient who could do harm to himself or others.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Concerns notwithstanding, self-diagnostic technology is coming, in condition-specific devices like <a href=\"http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/Can-This-Bra-Detect-Cancer-177245221.html\">a bra that detects breast cancer</a> and general-purpose machines like the tricorder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first-gen <a href=\"http://www.scanadu.com/\">Scanadu Scout</a>, which falls nicely within the thermometer test zone, should be hitting the market in late 2013.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Like all data, medical information is useful only if its used properly. Here's hoping that patients accept some responsibility along with their flashy new devices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Lead image from Memory Alpha.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Mkm1ieAPozjKGGTRg9G0z-X1HK8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Mkm1ieAPozjKGGTRg9G0z-X1HK8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Mkm1ieAPozjKGGTRg9G0z-X1HK8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Mkm1ieAPozjKGGTRg9G0z-X1HK8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=bWix-IavfBg:oVb24wSq8DE:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/bWix-IavfBg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/bWix-IavfBg/the-tricorder-x-prize-the-biggest-thing-in-home-health-care-since-the-thermometer", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/the-tricorder-x-prize-the-biggest-thing-in-home-health-care-since-the-thermometer", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa00012b')}])

Who has the technological advantage in the long term: Apple's Siri or Google Now? I think the answer is simply \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Kontra, a pseudonymous tech thinker, published a <a href=\"http://counternotions.com/2012/11/12/siri-future/\">compelling post</a> on the question Monday, pointing to some of Apple's advantages. For an artificially intelligent assistant, context is everything. Kontra argues that Apple's ecosystem of native apps has the potential to provide more context about the user than Google's Web-backed environment can.</p>\n<p>Siri has access to much more sensitive, personal information than Google, because Apple is directly involved in all kinds of transactions. As Siri gains more access to third-party applications, it will be able to fine tune the context of what you're asking because ambient information about who you are and what you do is right there on the phone.</p>\n<p>Kontra's example of what one means by \"nice restaurant\" is instructive. The highly subjective word \"nice\" can be approximated by looking at online reviews, but what it really needs is information about your budget, spending habits, diet and so on. Google can see some of what you're interested in and shopping for, but it doesn't have your Passbook or OpenTable purchase history to peruse directly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theresanappforus\">There's An App For Us</h2>\n<p>Kontra thinks Apple has the advantage here because we store that kind of information readily in native apps but don't display it proudly on the Web. That's why Google has to resort to tracking and watching our browsing habits to extrapolate the context. It's more complicated than our straightforward relationships with native apps, so perhaps it's more likely to fail.</p>\n<p>More importantly, Google loses access to that information when people use iOS devices. Everything someone does with a native app is something he or she <em>doesn't</em> do with Google on the Web. Google can still try to track iOS users when they're on the Web, but that gives it an incomplete picture, making it more likely that Google will be wrong if it tries to guess.</p>\n<p>On Android, things are different, since Google can more effectively integrate its Web services into the native experience. But Google is a very long way from crafting the privacy policy — let alone building the trust — it would need to start indexing your bank account through your banking app and using that to personalize your search results.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn't have to do that. With Siri integration into apps, the sensitive transactions will happen on your own device. They won't be shared with other services via the Web.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howgoogleseestheworld\">How Google Sees The World</h2>\n<p>But Google has enormous advantages over Apple that we can't overlook. Its scale gives it enough data to be able to freely translate inputs between languages, automatically scan millions of videos for content, recognize objects in images, respond to world events in real time, <em>and</em> provide better mail, contacts and calendar support than Apple.</p>\n<p>Kontra's right that Google is playing catch-up on the technologies needed for the later versions of this technology. Google+ Local is a poor substitute for Yelp (or Foursquare, which <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/10/02/apple-should-still-buy-foursquare-now-more-than-ever\">Apple should buy</a>). Google Wallet has found no purchase, while major companies are already signing on to Passbook. Google Play is working really hard to be as good as iTunes, but it looks hopeless. And in businesses like travel, hotels and daily deals, Google has to buy expensive companies to stay in the game. Apple just has to keep the lights on in the App Store.</p>\n<p>But there's one technological point that trumps all these business ones: Voice control is an <em>interface</em>. People will use the best interface to do what they need to do, period. Right now, slabs of glass with sensors and microphones are the best we've got, and Apple does seem to be better able to monetize those.</p>\n<p>But Google maps the entire world and teaches cars to drive in it. Apple may be able to learn more about its customers, but Google knows more about <em>the world</em> and how people move through it. Its research with Project Glass is all about vision as an interface, imposing Google's rich layers of data on the world directly to guide us through it. There may be conveniences there that Apple can never match.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IJ_cVMT78u4QKkVo9FOoyySJYdk/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IJ_cVMT78u4QKkVo9FOoyySJYdk/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IJ_cVMT78u4QKkVo9FOoyySJYdk/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IJ_cVMT78u4QKkVo9FOoyySJYdk/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=YZmpcyith40:U5G1vzsOej4:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/YZmpcyith40\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/YZmpcyith40/who-has-the-advantage-siri-or-google-now", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/who-has-the-advantage-siri-or-google-now", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa00012e')}])

He's sick of getting hit with huge fees to send messages to his team's fans and followers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Two weeks ago <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban\" target=\"_blank\">Cuban tweeted</a> out a screen grab of an offer he'd received from Facebook. The social network wanted to charge him $3,000 to reach 1 million people. Along with the screen grab, Cuban wrote, \"FB is blowing it? This is the first step. The Mavs are considering moving to Tumblr or to new MySpace as primary site.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/M%20Cuban%20big%20screen%20shot.png\" style=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now Cuban tells me he's doing more than <em>considering</em> a move - he's doing it. And not just with the Mavs but with the 70 or so companies in which he has invested.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"We are moving far more aggressively into Twitter and reducing any and all emphasis on Facebook,\" Cuban says, via email. \"We won't abandon Facebook, we will still use it, but our priority is to add followers that our brands can reach on non-Facebook platforms first.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cuban and other corporate Facebook members are howling because new rules on the social network make it harder for brands to reach people without spending big money on sponsored posts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That's because in September Facebook changed the algorithm that controls which messages get through to which members. The result is that some brands a sharp dropoff in the reach of their posts - as much as 50% in some cases.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">It's Not A Shakedown - We're Trying To Fight Spam</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Facebook insists it isn't choking off reach as a way to push brands to spend more on sponsored posts. Facebook uses an algorithm called EdgeRank to determine which people see which posts. EdgeRank uses a lot of factors, including how often your friends log in to Facebook and what settings they choose on their news feeds, the company says.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Facebook constantly tinkers with EdgeRank to make it more effective, says product manager Will Cathcart. The algorithm change in September was a bigger change than usual, Cathcart says, but its goal was simply to cut down on spam in people's news feed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Still, Facebook seems more determined than ever to crank up its revenue, especially as its stock price has collapsed more than 50% since its initial public offering earlier this year.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cuban says the company's hunger for revenue is backfiring. In an email conversation, excerpted below, he lays out his case for moving away from Facebook:</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Why We're Looking Elsewhere</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"It's not feasible yet, but we have no choice but to continuously evaluate alternatives. We have already pushed more to Twitter. The new Myspace looks promising. And Instagram and Tumbler and others are much more open and are getting&nbsp;more of our attention.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"The big negative for Facebook is that we will no longer push for likes or subscribers because we can't reach them all. Why would we invest in extending our Facebook audience size if we have to pay to reach them? That's crazy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"In many respects it has already blown up on Facebook. Their search for revenue has severely devalued every brand's following and completely changed the economics of consumer interaction.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Brands Have Made A Bad Investment</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"Brands have invested in getting consumers to like their Facebook page with the presumption that every <em>like</em> is created equal, that the brand can reach the user easily. That is not the case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I realize that Facebook has never given 100% user coverage to followers of a brand. However it now appears that to extend beyond minimal reach is going to cost brands more money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I think this is a reflection of Facebook searching for more revenue since going public and the more it costs to reach followers on Facebook the lower the value to the brand of being on Facebook.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">I Wouldn't Buy Facebook Stock</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I haven't bought [at the current price] and I wouldn't buy here. I think they have to determine what their business is right now and how they will make money at it. I don't believe they are clear about either.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Using Myspace Is Not As Crazy As You Think</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"Actually, Myspace is going through a reformatting that looks pretty good. There is a greater than zero chance that it could gather quite a bit of momentum.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"In addition to Myspace, Twitter and Tumblr are both ready, willing and able to support brand activation without holding followers hostage for additional revenue. And in the ironic department, Instagram has the same friction-free reach to followers that Twitter and Tumblr have but Facebook doesn't.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Why Brands Feel Betrayed</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"Facebook has never allowed 100% reach. I think the disconnect is that not everyone realized that they didnt allow 100% reach. I bet if you asked &nbsp;anyone who has subscribers if their posts reached 100% of their subscribers, they would say yes unless they have seen the dollar box for promoted posts show up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I think the same applies to brands as well. Remember most brands don't have social media departments. They rely on common sense. If someone likes your brand, it seems like common sense to me that you can expect your posts to reach 100% of those that like your brand. Doesn't it to you?\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Facebook Has A Fundamental Business Model Problem</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"And one more point. I get that they want to reduce the speed at which news scrolls off of people's Facebook pages. The more stuff, the less you see; the less you see, the less you engage. All good points by Facebook.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"But it's a reflection of overall design and strategy weakness. Again, why would a brand invest in getting likes they can't reach without paying a premium?\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">I'd Rather Pay An Upfront Fee</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"The right price is to charge an upfront fee for brands. In the current system there is complete uncertainty on the cost. And even worse, at least for our size brands, you have to deal with the pricing for each posting, which is a time waster.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I'm just suggesting that a single upfront fee or a monthly fee where there is certainty of cost would allow brands to focus on bringing in consumers to like the brands knowing that they can always reach everyone that likes them. I don't know what that number should be.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"And let me add, I'm not trying to come off as some Facebook expert. I'm not. I have a bunch of little companies via <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank\" target=\"_blank\">SharkTank</a> and other investments that use Facebook in the normal course of business. They shouldn't have go to great lengths to figure out the nuances of Facebook audience reach. That complexity, IMHO, will come back to haunt Facebook.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Read on: Macromedia's Marc Canter says, <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/14/mark-cubans-like-gate-is-a-turning-point-for-the-industry\">Hell, yeah!</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Image courtesy of Reuters.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/JI0Zo6U1D2Y0KWFMYh1Xr_o6-1s/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/JI0Zo6U1D2Y0KWFMYh1Xr_o6-1s/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/JI0Zo6U1D2Y0KWFMYh1Xr_o6-1s/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/JI0Zo6U1D2Y0KWFMYh1Xr_o6-1s/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=HoNOpxyFyAI:IYaJQTu3CQ0:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/HoNOpxyFyAI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/HoNOpxyFyAI/mark-cuban-facebooks-sponsored-posts-are-driving-away-brands", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/mark-cuban-facebooks-sponsored-posts-are-driving-away-brands", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000131')}])

MONGODB (0ms) rails3_mongoid_devise_development['articles'].insert([{"headline"=>"Yammer + SharePoint: Microsoft's Social Strategy Isn't Social At All, But Collaborative", "deck"=>"<p>Microsoft continued its embrace of social media by announcing on Monday that it would cut prices for its recent Yammer acquisition and tie the corporate social network closer to its enterprise collaboration tool, SharePoint, both now and through future integration.</p>\n<p>At the opening of its SharePoint conference this week, Microsoft said that Yammer can be tied to SharePoint via what the company calls <a href=\"https://www.yammer.com/company/sharepoint\" target=\"_blank\">Yammer Web Parts </a>and the new Yammer Open Graph capabilities. But over time, Microsoft plans to invest in unified identity, integrated document management and feed aggregation for both services, possibly turning SharePoint into a “powered by Yammer” application.</p>\n<h2>Is Social Nothing More Than A Collaboration Tool?</h2>\n<p>What’s clear, however, is that Microsoft feels that social is simply another tool for collaboration, whether it be in the consumer or enterprise space. Microsoft bought Yammer for $1.2 billion in June, bringing its 5 million corporate users, including employees at 85% of the Fortune 500, into the Microsoft fold. At the time, Microsoft said that it planned to combine Yammer with products like Microsoft SharePoint, Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics and Skype. On Monday, Microsoft said that the SharePoint business has topped $2 billion in annual revenue, and two out of three enterprise workers now have SharePoint.</p>\n<p>In a way, Yammer is like a Skype for collaboration, an elemental product that Microsoft can combine with its other business products to form a stronger, more durable alloy. Microsoft lacks a consumer social strategy, preferring to partner with companies like Facebook to provide a social element to search. But in the enterprise, Yammer - along with independent rivals like Jive - might turn out to be one of SharePoint's structural strengths.</p>\n<p>That was reflected in a dramatic change in Yammer's pricing structure. Microsoft said that it would combine Yammer’s paid services into a single offering, Yammer Enterprise, and cut the price of the service from $15 per user per month to just $3. For Enterprise Agreement customers, the company announced plans to ship Yammer Enterprise with Microsoft SharePoint Online and the Office 365 Enterprise plans with no change in price for existing customers.</p>\n<h2>Making Office 365 More Valuable</h2>\n<p>David Sacks, the former chief executive of Yammer and now a corporate vice president at Microsoft, said that the new pricing was designed to bring Yammer into SharePoint - and, perhaps more importantly, into the Office-as-a-Subscription service that is Office 365. <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/09/24/do-you-really-want-to-subscribe-to-microsoft-office-yes-you-might\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft has discounted Office 365 as a play to get customers to sign up for stable, recurring revenue</a> rather than evaluate each new release and decide whether or not to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This means customers get the best cloud productivity service and the best enterprise social service together - Office 365 plus Yammer,” Sacks said in a statement. “These packaging changes are just a first step into a future where Yammer will power new social experiences across your business applications.”</p>\n<p>“We believe in collaboration technologies that we can give to people to help them get work done, to help break down silos and organizations, to help organizations be more effective, to reach out to customers and partners to get business done better than ever before,” said Jared Spataro, senior director of the Office Division at Microsoft, in a SharePoint conference keynote address on Monday. “So at our core it’s the same vision. But we’re very complementary, Sharepoint... came at this more from the documents and sites and applications space, Yammer came at this more from the social conversation space, so there’s a very natural synergy between the two.”</p>\n<h2>Is There A Wedding Date For The Yammer-Sharepoint Nuptials?</h2>\n<p>Although Microsoft could save the longer-term collaboration for a new Office release, it’s not entirely clear that it will do so. Spataro said that once Microsoft has its “foundational investments” in place, the company will be “taking advantage of our new, 90-day release cycle for SharePoint Online and Office 365 to add new capabilities that move us toward our vision of connected experiences that combine social, collaboration, email, and unified communications.” That suggests regular point releases to move the pace of integration forward.</p>\n<p>Microsoft also made a number of announcements concerning SharePoint, whose 2013 release includes recommendations; fast search; task management across SharePoint, Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Project; drag and drop (a popular addition, judging by the audience reaction); and saving to the cloud by default, &nbsp;Jeff Teper, a corporate vice president at Microsoft, told the SharePoint conference in a keynote address&nbsp;on Monday.</p>\n<p>That, combined with new SharePoint apps for Windows Phone 8, Windows 8, Android and iOS, turns “Office into a Kindle or Netflix environment,” Teper said. “It remembers the documents I’ve read, it remembers the focus; if I’m in PowerPoint, it jumps right to that slide.”</p>\n<p>Microsoft also announced new tools for developing apps for Office and SharePoint with Visual Studio 2012 that work with the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/archive/2012/07/17/introducing-napa-office-365-development-tools.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Napa</a>&nbsp;tools for online development of Office 365 apps, include templates and designers to facilitate app development, and support the LightSwitch HTML client for creation of data-centric business apps in SharePoint 2013, Microsoft said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/xAEDaqt3zFtEBgamCQmwUw7GkhU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/xAEDaqt3zFtEBgamCQmwUw7GkhU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/xAEDaqt3zFtEBgamCQmwUw7GkhU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/xAEDaqt3zFtEBgamCQmwUw7GkhU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ZK-rMSpKJ5c:MES77k80DEI:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/ZK-rMSpKJ5c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/ZK-rMSpKJ5c/yammer-sharepoint-microsofts-social-strategy-isnt-social-at-all-but-collaborative", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/yammer-sharepoint-microsofts-social-strategy-isnt-social-at-all-but-collaborative", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000133')}])

I'm guessing you're not waiting in line to get the first BlackBerry 10 smartphones.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://us.blackberry.com/campaigns/blackberry-10.html\">Research In Motion revealed the launch event date</a></span> on Monday. Other than that, the company offered few specifics, saying only: \"The event will happen simultaneously in multiple countries around the world, where details of the smartphones and their availability will be announced.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can't wait.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No. Literally, I can't wait.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">The Mobile World Has Already Moved On</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">And neither can anybody else. In fact, very few people have been willing to wait for the BlackBerry 10 mobile operating system. Instead they've been busy snapping up Apple iOS and Google Android devices as fast as they can. The preternaturally patient ones hung out for Windows Phone 8, and even they don't have to wait any more.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If BlackBerry 10 had been released on January 30, <em>2012</em>, it still might have been too late. But by 2013, RIM's window of opportunity seems slammed shut.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It's not that BlackBerry 10 will be worthless. Indications are that the new operating system has a number of interesting features (more on that later). It's more that it no longer matters how good it is unless it's massively better than what's already out there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Just as good isn't good enough. Heck, even quite-a-bit-better probably isn't good enough. Don't believe me? Ask the folks who worked on Palm's webOS.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sure, big companies deeply invested in the BlackBerry ecosystem may hang around another generation or two. But most of them are already looking for a way out. I just heard of a big company I used to work with that's replacing users' BlackBerrys with the iPhone 4. Yup, not the 5 or even the 4S, the freakin' 4. A two-generations-out-of-date iPhone was enough to keep them from waiting for BlackBerry 10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">BlackBerry Isn't Worthless, Just Doomed</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">All this doesn't mean that there's no value in BlackBerry 10, especially for enterprises. As ReadWrite's Dan Rowinksi pointed out in September (<a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/09/25/rim-unveils-blackberry-10-aiming-to-both-fit-in-stand-out\">Showing Off BlackBerry 10, RIM Aims To Both Fit In &amp; Stand Out</a>), new features include</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>BlackBerry Hub:</strong> an always-on inbox that stores emails, texts, calendar, events and BlackBerry Messenger.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>BlackBerry Balance:</strong> which customizes the user experience between personal and work interfaces.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Predictive Text:</strong> which the company hopes will revolutionize typing on mobile devices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Active Frames:</strong> small, developer-customizable widgets that live on the device's home screen - a cross between Android Widgets and Windows Phone 8 Live Tiles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Will all that be enough to RIM relevant again? Back in June, <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/06/01/readwriteweb-deathwatch-research-in-motion\">Research In Motion was ReadWrite's first ever DeathWatch</a>. Nothing that's happened since has done anything to commute BlackBerry's sentence. And nothing that happens on January 30th is likely to help either.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>One more thing:</strong> Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against BlackBerry. I was a user for years, and really liked my Curve - until those fancy iPhones and Androids made me envious. Back in April, I wrote <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/04/14/a-requiem-for-rim\" target=\"_blank\">A Requiem For RIM</a>&nbsp;lauding some of the things that I loved about the BlackBerry. I still have a soft spot in my heart for the company and hope we are all wrong about its future.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\" target=\"_blank\">Shutterstock</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Vbc6oJmpr2ChzJ7czzkXahbSOiY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Vbc6oJmpr2ChzJ7czzkXahbSOiY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Vbc6oJmpr2ChzJ7czzkXahbSOiY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Vbc6oJmpr2ChzJ7czzkXahbSOiY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:Ij26kaj3iuU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:C2pbw5bZMiI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:HaYztYP2wyo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:fvyXWMd9xfE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Emsyph9gACU:VajLpB44sUk:OqabYuBsmOY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/Emsyph9gACU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "story"=>nil, "url"=>"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/Emsyph9gACU/blackberry-10-launch-date-announced-but-its-too-late", "published_on"=>2012-11-13 00:00:00 UTC, "guid"=>"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/blackberry-10-launch-date-announced-but-its-too-late", "is_published"=>false, "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('50a3d4671d44b6b5aa000135')}])
