Problem:
  No sessions configuration provided.
Summary:
  Mongoid's configuration requires that you provide details about each session that can be connected to, and requires in the sessions config at least 1 default session to exist.
Resolution:
  Double check your mongoid.yml to make sure that you have a top-level sessions key with at least 1 default session configuration for it. You can regenerate a new mongoid.yml for assistance via `rails g mongoid:config`.

 Example:
   development:
     sessions:
       default:
         database: mongoid_dev

           - localhost:27017

ActionView::Template::Error (
Problem:
  No sessions configuration provided.
Summary:
  Mongoid's configuration requires that you provide details about each session that can be connected to, and requires in the sessions config at least 1 default session to exist.
Resolution:
  Double check your mongoid.yml to make sure that you have a top-level sessions key with at least 1 default session configuration for it. You can regenerate a new mongoid.yml for assistance via `rails g mongoid:config`.

 Example:
   development:
     sessions:
       default:
         database: mongoid_dev
         hosts:
           - localhost:27017
